# README: Script for Detecting Potential Backdoors and Obfuscation in Server Scripts
# Overview
This script is designed to scan server scripts for potential backdoors, malicious code, and obfuscation patterns. It works by searching for specific signatures and patterns within the code that are commonly associated with security risks. This can include suspicious URLs, encoded strings, or certain functions that may indicate an attempt to hide malicious behavior.

# How It Works
- Signature-Based Detection: The script includes a predefined set of patterns (signatures) that are known to be associated with security risks. It scans files for these patterns and flags any occurrences.

- Hexadecimal Decoding: The script decodes hexadecimal strings within the code, which can sometimes be used to hide malicious behavior. This helps ensure that the script can detect obfuscated patterns.

- Directory Scanning: The script scans a specified directory and all its subdirectories, looking for files with certain extensions (e.g., .lua). It only scans files that match these extensions.

- Logging: The script logs its scanning process, including which files were scanned, skipped, or flagged. It also records any detected suspicious patterns and provides detailed information, such as the line number and description of the flagged content.

- Cloning Flagged Files: If any files are flagged, the script clones them into a separate directory for further analysis. This helps isolate potentially harmful code from the rest of the system.

# How to Use
# 1. Installation
Ensure that Node.js is installed on your system, as this script is written in JavaScript.

# 2. Running the Script
Navigate to the Script Location: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where this script is located.

Start the Script: Run the script using Node.js by typing the following command:

# node your-script-name.js

Replace your-script-name.js with the actual name of the script file.

Enter the Directory to Scan: When prompted, enter the path to the directory you wish to scan. This can be a relative or absolute path.

Review the Log: The script will create two log files:

scan_log.txt: Contains general information about the scan process, such as which files were scanned or skipped.

flagged_log.txt: Contains detailed information about any files that were flagged, including the specific lines of code and the associated risk description.

Check Flagged Files: If any files are flagged, they will be copied to a directory named flagged_files_clone in the same location as the script. You can review these files to investigate potential issues further.

# 3. Script Output
No Issues Found: If no suspicious patterns are detected, the script will log this and complete the process without cloning any files.
Issues Detected: If suspicious patterns are found, detailed information will be logged, and flagged files will be cloned for further examination.

# Important Notes
# False Positives: The script uses signature-based detection, which may result in false positives. Always review flagged files manually to determine if they pose a genuine threat.
# Security Best Practices: Regularly scan your server scripts and stay updated with the latest security practices to minimize the risk of backdoors and other vulnerabilities.
# This script is a valuable tool for enhancing security by detecting potential risks in server scripts. However, it is not a substitute for comprehensive security audits and practices.
